        <h1>GitHub Page Documentation</h1>
        <h2>Step 1: Initial Setup</h2>
        <p>
            The first step in creating a GitHub page is setting up your repository. Make sure that your repository is public and named in the format <code>username.github.io</code>. This is crucial as GitHub automatically maps this format to serve the site at <code>https://username.github.io/</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre><code>
            git init
            git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Step 2: Designing the Webpage</h2>
        <p>
            My initial struggle was designing a clean, responsive webpage. I had limited knowledge of CSS at the time, but I managed to learn by looking at templates, and using tools like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> helped me get a basic layout running quickly.
        </p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Website wireframe">
        <p>
            The image above shows the wireframe of the webpage I was aiming to create. The key sections included:
            <ul>
                <li>Home</li>
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>Contact</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Publishing the Site</h2>
        <p>
            Publishing the site was straightforward, but I initially faced problems with ensuring the correct branch was set for GitHub Pages. I learned that for project pages, I needed to configure it to use the <code>gh-pages</code> branch:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre><code>
            git checkout -b gh-pages
            git push origin gh-pages
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            After pushing the branch, I checked the repository settings and ensured the source branch for GitHub Pages was set to <code>gh-pages</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 4: Struggles Faced</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most significant challenges was version control with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I initially faced difficulty keeping track of changes across different branches. However, learning more about Git commands like <code>git log</code>, <code>git stash</code>, and <code>git diff</code> helped me a lot.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 5: Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            Through the process, I learned the importance of:
            <ul>
                <li>Responsive web design (making sure your page works well on all devices)</li>
                <li>Utilizing version control effectively with Git</li>
                <li>Hosting static sites using GitHub Pages</li>
                <li>Troubleshooting issues with publishing by checking GitHub Pagesâ€™ logs and settings</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Creating a GitHub page was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to build a personal website while learning key concepts of web design and development. Although I faced many obstacles, each challenge helped me become a better developer.
