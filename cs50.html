            <h3>My CS50 Experience</h3>
            <p>
              CS50's Introduction to Computer Science provides an overview of basic programming. The course begins with an introduction to binary numbers. It teaches the concept of bits and bytes. This course is suitable for both students that have no background in CS and also for more experienced programmer. The course provides an introduction to languages like C, Phyton, JavaScript, as well as other programming languages. This course allows students to catch up with the topics with problem sets every week. I think that this course really helped me to get familiar with different programming languages and the concept of programming.
