            <h3>Project 1: CS50 Final Project - Web Application</h3>
            <p>
                For my CS50 final project, I built a web application using Flask, SQL, and Python. The app enables users to create accounts, manage tasks, and track their progress. This project gave me valuable experience with full-stack development.

            <p>
                For one of CS50's problem sets, I developed a stock trading simulation platform. It allows users to buy and sell stocks using real-time market data, and it was built using Python and SQL. This project helped me understand API integration and backend logic.
