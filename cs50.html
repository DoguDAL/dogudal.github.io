            <h3>My CS50 Experience</h3>
            <p>
              CS50's Introduction to Computer Science provides an overview of basic programming. The course begins with an introduction to binary numbers. It teaches the concept of bits and bytes. This course is suitable for both students that have no background in CS and also for more experienced programmer. The course provides an introduction to languages like C, Phyton, JavaScript, as well as other programming languages. This course allows students to catch up with the topics with problem sets every week. I think that this course really helped me to get familiar with different programming languages and the concept of programming.

            <h3>Project 2: CS50 Problem Set - Finance</h3>
            <p>
                For one of CS50's problem sets, I developed a stock trading simulation platform. It allows users to buy and sell stocks using real-time market data, and it was built using Python and SQL. This project helped me understand API integration and backend logic.

            <h3>Project 3: CS50 Problem Set - Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                This project involves building a sentiment analysis tool using Python and machine learning. It processes text data to classify the sentiment as positive or negative. The project explores natural language processing and data science techniques.
