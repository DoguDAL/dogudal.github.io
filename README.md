## Swift 
### Goals: 
Learning the effect of computing on people's lives. Reducing bias and learning app designing process.
### What is Programming?
Input-->Algorithm-->Output.
Everything in our world can be captured as data. Data is a a collection of individual values.
### Expression: 
Representing a value
### Identifiers:
Reveals the intent of your code, like names. Makes the code easier to debug. It helps you understand the code when you look at it after a certain time.
### String:
Text values that are made out of characters (Doesn't necesarrily need to be letters; can be numbers, blanks etc.)
### Constant & Variable:
Constants don't change, example: Eye Colour
Variables may change, example: Hair length
Constants also reduce the chance of making mistakes in a code since they are less complex compared to variables.
### Computer Simulations
Computer simulations both cost less then real life dummy experiments and provide more accurate data then those experiments using dummies.
